<summary>I am not able to import components or utilties.</summary>

> This pacakge uses npm-exports to export all the components and utilities.
> This should work normally with latest Node.js versions but sometimes the version of TypeScript used in your project might not support this feature.
>
> In that case, you can use the following syntax to import components and utilities from sub-paths:
>
> ```tsx
> import ScrollyElement from "react-scrolly-telling/dist/element";
> ```
>
> Adding `dist` to the import path should fix the issue. Though, you should figure out why your project is not supporting npm-exports.
