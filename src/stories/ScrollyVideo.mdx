# ScrollyVideo

This component plays a video in the background and allows for scrolling through the content. The video playback is linked to scroll and changes based on the scroll position.

## Usage

Note: There should be a `ScrollyProvider` higher up in the tree for `ScrollyVideo` to work.

[View Story](?path=/story/components-scrollyvideo--default)

```tsx
import ScrollyVideo from "react-scrolly-telling/video";

function App() {
  return (
    <ScrollyVideo
      src={"https://scrollyvideo.js.org/goldengate.mp4"}
      // More height allows more area to scroll throught the video.
      style={{ height: "200vh" }}
    />
  );
}
```

## API

The component accepts the following props:

- `src`: The source url of the video.
- `playFromEntry`: If true, the video starts playing as soon as the element enters the screen. If false, the video starts playing when the element has reached the top of the screen. Defaults to `false`.
- `playTillExit`: If true, the video plays till the element has completely exited the screen. If false, the video stops playing when the element starts exiting the screen. Defaults to `false`.
- Any props that are accepted by `div`. These props are passed to ScrollyElement.

Note: Since the `ScrollyVideo` is wrapper around `ScrollyElemnet`, its children can access ScrollyValues with `useScrollyElementContext` hook.
